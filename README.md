# üëã Hi there! I'm kobaltgit.

This is my sandbox profile where I'm experimenting with an unconventional approach to coding that I've been calling "vibe coding" ‚Äî inspired by Andrej Karpathy's concept of "vibe-driven development" in the context of neural networks.

The gist is simple: **I barely know the syntax of any programming language.** Instead of writing code, I try to "negotiate" with an AI (mostly Google Gemini), describing ideas and logic in plain human language. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't.

I often doubt my own competence, but I'm fascinated by the process itself: is it possible to create useful things by acting more like a "human-to-machine translator" with an AI as the intermediary? These projects are my attempt to answer that question.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It (Usually) Works (or Doesn't)

1.  **Idea:** A thought pops up, like "What if I made a thing that does...".
2.  **Dialogue with AI:** I start describing this idea to Gemini. It offers the first version of the code. I run it, see errors, describe them back to the AI, clarify what I meant, and we repeat this loop over and over.
3.  **Result:** Eventually, if I have enough patience, an application emerges. All the code in my repositories was written by an AI under my direction.
